    <h1>Official Formbar User Manual </h1>
    <p>Here you can find everything necessary to understanding the formbar, this is a much more siplified version of our
        github wiki, we hope you enjoy using the formbar.</p>

                <h3>Thumbspanel</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>The thumbspanel will allow you to answer polls which are started by the teacher. You can also ask
                        for help or to go to the bathroom from here.</p>
                    <h4> Types Of Polls</h4>
                    <p> The first time of poll, a thumbs poll, is answered with the up, down, and wiggle buttons which
                        simulates the way a person moves their thumb in respons to a question. Upon hitting one on these
                        you wil be prompted with a message telling you "thank you for your answer" or "you already
                        submitted this answer."</p>
                    <img src="/static/img/usermanual/thumbs.png" style="width:490px;">
                    <p>The next is a 4 answer poll which uses the A, B, C, and D buttons, this is typically a multiple
                        choice question. Clicking these when an ABCD poll is active will result in the same message that
                        the up, down, and wiggle gave.</p>
                    <img src="/static/img/usermanual/abcd.png" style="width:490px;">
                    <p>The final type is an essay button which will take any response you input. This is of course for
                        open ended questions, and more personal surveys.</p>
                    <h4>Other Thumbspanel Features</h4>
                    <p>By entering either the bathroom break or help sections, with a simple click you can let the
                        teacher know you need help, or that you really gotta go to the bathroom. Remember if you send a
                        help ticket, keep working out the issue until the teacher comes to your aid.</p>

                        your message will be sent to all others in the class.</p>
                    <p>There is also edit and delete functions represented by the blue pencil and red wastebin. Each
                        will display a prompt asking you to confirm the action.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Not reccomended for those who don't understand the formbar well, it'll allow you to do everything
                        the normal formbar can in a much more compact interface. It's a lot more technical than the
                        normal layout and, once again, not reccomended for new users.</p>

                        are dependant on user preference, we reccomend sticking with default until you understand the
